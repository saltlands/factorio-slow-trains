# Slow Trains #

Slows down trains, because the default speeds are silly.

Instead of a base speed of 259 km/h, the base speed is 86 km/h (1/3 default).
Braking force is reduced, so trains take longer to slow down.

Braking force research still reduces the braking distance.
Advanced fuels still increase the acceleration and maximum speed, but still
below the vanilla values.
